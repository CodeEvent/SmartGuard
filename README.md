## 📖 Overview

SmartGuard is a static analysis extension for the **Slither** security framework designed to detect **business-logic vulnerabilities** in Solidity smart contracts used in decentralised finance (DeFi) systems.

Traditional static analysis tools primarily detect low-level technical vulnerabilities such as:

- Reentrancy
- Integer overflow
- Unchecked external calls

However, many real-world cryptocurrency fraud incidents are caused by insecure **business logic**, not programming errors.  
SmartGuard addresses this gap by identifying patterns commonly observed in fraudulent smart contracts.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Existing static analysis tools do not effectively detect behavioural vulnerabilities that enable financial exploitation in DeFi environments.

These vulnerabilities may allow attackers to:

- Mint unlimited tokens
- Impersonate legitimate cryptocurrencies
- Execute privileged functions without authorization
- Transfer ownership without validation
- Withdraw funds without access control

SmartGuard was developed to automatically detect these high-risk patterns using static analysis techniques.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

SmartGuard provides:

- Static analysis of Solidity smart contracts
- Custom vulnerability detectors
- Integration with the Slither analysis framework
- Automated evaluation workflow
- False positive validation against legitimate contracts
- Reproducible experimental dataset
- Demonstration script for validation
- Academic research implementation

## 🧠 SmartGuard Detectors

SmartGuard implements three custom vulnerability detectors.

| Detector | Identifier | Severity | Description |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| UnlimitedMint | `unlimited-mint` | HIGH | Detects mint functions without supply limits or authorization controls |
| FakeTokenName | `fake-token-name` | MEDIUM | Detects contracts impersonating well-known cryptocurrency tokens |
| UnprotectedCriticalFunction | `unprotected-critical-function` | HIGH | Detects sensitive administrative functions callable without access control |

## 🏗 System Architecture

SmartGuard integrates with the Slither static analysis engine.

## 📊 Evaluation Results

SmartGuard was evaluated using a dataset containing both fraudulent and legitimate smart contracts.

### Dataset Composition

- 7 fraudulent contracts  
- 10 legitimate contracts  
- **Total: 17 contracts**

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|-------|-------|
| True Positives | 25 |
| True Negatives | 10 |
| False Positives | 0 |
| False Negatives | 0 |
| Precision | 100% |
| Recall | 100% |
| F1-Score | 100% |

These results demonstrate reliable detection performance with zero false positives in the evaluation dataset.

## ⚙ Requirements

The following software must be installed before running SmartGuard:

- Python 3.10  
- Slither 0.11.5  
- Solidity compiler 0.8.0  
- PowerShell or Linux terminal  

---

## 🛠 Installation

Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/CodeEvent/SmartGuard.git
cd SmartGuard

Create a virtual environment:

py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Install dependencies:

pip install slither-analyzer solc-select -e .

Install Solidity compiler:

solc-select install 0.8.0
solc-select use 0.8.0
✅ Verification

Verify installation:

python --version
slither --version
slither --list-detectors

Expected output should include:

unlimited-mint
fake-token-name
unprotected-critical-function
▶ Usage

Run SmartGuard detection on a smart contract:

slither contracts/scam/test_mint.sol --detect unlimited-mint,fake-token-name,unprotected-critical-function
🎬 Demonstration

Run the automated demonstration script:

.\demo.ps1

The demonstration performs:

Detector registration verification
Baseline Slither analysis
SmartGuard detection execution
False positive validation
🔬 Reproducibility

All experimental results can be reproduced using:

The provided dataset
SmartGuard detectors
The demonstration script
The documented evaluation workflow

This ensures:

Transparency
Scientific validity
Academic integrity
⚠ Limitations

SmartGuard currently focuses on business-logic vulnerabilities and does not detect:

Reentrancy vulnerabilities
Integer overflow
Gas optimization issues
Runtime execution vulnerabilities
🔮 Future Work

Future development may include:

Dynamic analysis integration
Machine learning classification
Real-time blockchain monitoring
Expanded vulnerability detection coverage
🧰 Technologies Used
Python
Solidity
Slither
